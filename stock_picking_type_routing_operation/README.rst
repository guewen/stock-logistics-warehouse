Route explains the steps you want to produce whereas the “picking zone” defines
how operations are grouped according to their final source and destination
location.

This allows for example:

* To parallelize picking operations in two main zone of a warehouse, splitting
  them in two different picking type
* To define pre-picking (wave) in some sub-zones, then roundtrip picking of the
  sub-zone waves

Configuration
=============

In Inventory Settings, you must have:

 * Storage Locations
 * Multi-Warehouses
 * Multi-Step Routes

Create an operation type and activate the "Is Zone" checkbox.
The default destination location will be the destination location
of the new operation inserted when a move has a source location which
is a child of the type's source location.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

The concept of "zone" is duplicated with the zones introduced by
"stock_location_zone" in
https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/pull/653
They will be merged in the same concept. Note that considering the
alpha version of this module, no data migration will be done.
