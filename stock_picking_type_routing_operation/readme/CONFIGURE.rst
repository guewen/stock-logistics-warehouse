In Inventory Settings, you must have:

 * Storage Locations
 * Multi-Warehouses
 * Multi-Step Routes

On stock location, create an "Routing operation" operation type.
The default destination location will be the destination location
of the new operation inserted when a move has a source location which
is a child of the location.
