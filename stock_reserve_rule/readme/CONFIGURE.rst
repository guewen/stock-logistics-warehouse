The configuration of the rules is done in "Inventory > Configuration > Stock Reservation".

Creation of a rule:

Properties that define where the rule will be applied:

* Location: Define where the rule will look for goods (include sub-locations).
* Rule Domain: A rule can be included only if the Stock Move matches a domain.

Properties that define how the rule is applied:

* Quants Domain: this domain includes/excludes quants based on a domain.
* Advanced Removal Strategy: the strategy that will be used for this location
  and sub-location when the rule is used.

The sequences have to be sorted in the view list to define the reservation priorities.
